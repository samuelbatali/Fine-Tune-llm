# Fine-Tuning an LLM for Child-Safe Comment Analysis

## Overview
This project aims to fine-tune a language model (LLM) to analyze and filter inappropriate comments on children's videos. The goal is to create a safer online environment for young audiences by automatically detecting and flagging harmful or unsuitable language in comments.

The fine-tuned model acts as a digital guardian, ensuring that only child-safe content is displayed in the comments section of children's videos.

## What is Fine-tuning?
Fine-tuning in machine learning refers to the process of adapting a pre-trained model for specific tasks or use cases. It is commonly used in deep learning, particularly with foundation models for generative AI. Fine-tuning allows us to leverage pre-trained models and adjust them for more specialized purposes.

## Project Workflow

### Step 1: Setting Up the Environment
- **Modules Required**: 
  - `openai`
  - `pandas`
  - `json`
  - `time`
  - `matplotlib`

- **API Setup**: 
  - The OpenAI API key is required to interact with the OpenAI services.

### Step 2: Data Preparation
- **Dataset**: User comments are loaded from a CSV file.
- **Formatting**: The data is transformed into a JSON format suitable for fine-tuning, including a system prompt to determine if a comment is appropriate for children.

### Step 3: Fine-tuning the LLM
- **Training Data Upload**: The prepared training data is uploaded to OpenAI’s servers.
- **Fine-tuning Job Creation**: A fine-tuning job is created using OpenAI’s GPT-3.5-turbo model.

### Step 4: Monitoring & Analyzing the Model
- **Monitoring**: The status of the fine-tuning job is monitored.
- **Training Loss & Accuracy**: Data on training loss and token accuracy is extracted and visualized.

### Step 5: Using the Fine-Tuned Model
- **Model Usage**: Once the model is fine-tuned, it can be used to analyze comments in real time, flagging them as either 'allow' or 'disallow' based on their appropriateness for children.


## Conclusion
This fine-tuned model helps create a safer online environment by automatically analyzing user comments on children's videos and identifying harmful or inappropriate content. By using a pre-trained LLM and adjusting it for this specific task, we can significantly improve moderation and content safety for young audiences.

## Requirements
